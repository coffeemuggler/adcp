Description: ADCP data from Sontek devices can be exported as Matlab (Mat)
    files. In order to work with such files in R, this package allows
    generic import functionality for such files. In addition, a plot
    function is added that allows visualisation of relevant data.
    Note that this package is currently under development and it is very
    likely that it contains a rish variety of bugs and missing functionalities.
